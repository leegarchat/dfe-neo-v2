    # Denylist Option:
    # This option writes application packages to the denylist upon startup. It works only if Magisk is installed.
    # You can manually configure the configuration file in `.zip/META-INF/tools/denylist.txt`.
    # `false` - disable
    # `ask` - prompt during installation,
    # `first_time_boot` - the script will be executed only once during the first boot, recording of first-time usage is stored in Magisk memory,
    # `always_on_boot` - the script will run every time during each boot of the system.
